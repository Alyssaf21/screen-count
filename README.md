### Update screen numbers in an instant!

_Renumber_ updates the numbers on your screen labels based on position (objects at the top are first, then left, right, and bottom). 

Just add the name of the label container, select the flow or frames you want to update, and hit "Renumber".

- Always starts from 1 (or A, if alphabetical is enabled) and counts up
- You can now use letters instead of numbers, or choose to append to the existing text instead of replacing it!

Originally published as "Screen Count", renamed for clarity 🧛
