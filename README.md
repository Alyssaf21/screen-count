### Number your screens in a couple clicks!

_Screen Count_ updates the numbers on your screen labels based on position (top to bottom, left to right). Just add the name of the label container, select the flow or frames you want to update, and hit "Renumber".

- Always starts from 1 (or A, if alphabetical is enabled) and counts up
- You can now use letters instead of numbers, or choose to append to the existing text instead of replacing it!
